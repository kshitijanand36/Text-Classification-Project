# Text-Classificaton-Project
In this project text classification is done using the multinomial naive bayes. In this project the naive bayes classifier is implemented first by myself and then it is compared with  the results obtained using the inbuilt naive bayes inside the sklearn.
For better explanation one can refer to my code where I have explained in much depth as to what I have done
