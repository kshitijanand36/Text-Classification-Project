# Text-Classification-Project
In this project we have been given many documents and we need to classify a particular document.The files on which the analysis has been done has a size of around 100mb.The analysis is done using the multinomial naive bayes.The  Naive Bayes classifier which is being used is implemented first by myself and then it is compared with  the results obtained using the inbuilt naive bayes inside the sklearn.
For better explanation one can refer to my code where I have explained in much depth as to what I have done.<br>
